# Bad Statuses

Damage isn't the only way to incapacitate enemies. Several bad statuses (also called "mez") can be used to hinder them.

Most bad statuses can be embedded in almost anything a creator wants to: weapons, skills/spells, consumables, and even wearable gear (i.e, a blindfold that always causes blind status).

Bad statuses have a **magnitude** and a **duration**. There are also attributes to defend against them.

## Bad Status List

### Stun

Stunned/disoriented characters are unable to attack and their active defenses are reduced (i.e., dodging).

### Hold

Characters can hold enemies (i.e., chokes, armlocks, etc). While held, characters are unable to attack and their active defenses are reduced. This also affects the character doing the hold.

Characters performing holds can break from the hold immediately with a command, or be forcibly broken from the hold if they're attacked by other enemies. Held characters require a skill check to break free.

### Immobilize

Immobilize characters are unable to use skills that use Movement Points. They are also unable to flee combat (as it would require leaving the room).

### Silence

Silenced characters cannot cast spells that require chanting.

### Sleep

Asleep characters are unable to attack and their active defenses are reduced. They will wake up if damaged or when hit by another bad status.

### Blindness

Blinded characters cannot select targets. They cannot use any skill that requires targets.

### Confusion

Confused characters will be unable to attack their enemies or buff their allies. They will, instead, be able to buff their enemies, and attack their allies. Confused characters can still be attacked normally by non-confused characters.

### Charming

Characters can charm enemies into doing their bidding. Charm spells usually have a very long duration (minutes) and must be re-casted to keep the charm effect going. If a character directly attacks a target that they previously charmed, the spell will be broken and the charmed character will be freed.
