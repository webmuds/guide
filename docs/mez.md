# Mez

Damage isn't the only way to incapacitate enemies. Several bad statuses (called "mez") can be used to hinder them.

Most mezzes can be embedded in almost anything a creator wants to: weapons, skills/spells, consumables, and even wearable gear (i.e, a blindfold that always causes Blindness).

Mezzes have a **magnitude** and a **duration**. There are also attributes to defend against them.

## Mez List

_(Variable prefixes in brackets)_

### Stun (`Stun`)

Stunned/disoriented characters are unable to attack and their active defenses are reduced (i.e., dodging).

### Hold (`Hold`)

Characters can hold enemies (i.e., armlocks, chokes, etc). 

While held, both characters involved in the hold are unable to attack and their active defenses are reduced.

Characters performing holds can break from the hold immediately with a command, or be forcibly broken off if they're attacked by other enemies. Held characters require a skill check to break free.

### Immobilize (`Immob`)

Immobilized characters are unable to use skills that use Movement Points. They are also unable to flee combat.

### Silence (`Silence`)

Silenced characters cannot cast spells that require chanting.

### Sleep (`Sleep`)

Asleep characters are unable to attack and their active defenses are reduced. They will wake up if damaged or when hit by another bad status.

### Blindness (`Blind`)

Blinded characters cannot select targets. They cannot use any skill that requires targets.

### Confusion (`Conf`)

Confused characters will be unable to attack their enemies or buff their allies. They will, instead, be able to buff their enemies, and attack their allies. Confused characters can still be attacked normally by non-confused characters.

### Charming (`Charm`)

Characters can charm enemies into doing their bidding. Charm spells usually have a very long duration (minutes) and must be re-casted to keep the charm effect going. If a character directly attacks a target that they previously charmed, the spell will be broken and the charmed character will be freed.

### Caging (`Cage`)

Caged characters are unable to move, and their skills won't affect others (allies or enemies). E.g., they can buff themselves but not others, and they can't attack anyone. They will also be invulnerable to incoming damage.
