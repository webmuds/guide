# Damage Types

WebMUDs provides a large list of damage types that can be chosen by creators.

* Creators can pick which damage types they want for their games.
* Each damage type has several related attributes that can be given in skills and gear.
* Damage types may have parent types. Defense and Resistance from parent types are added up in calculations.
* Custom damage types are available. Those can be named anything by creators. All custom types also have custom attributes.
